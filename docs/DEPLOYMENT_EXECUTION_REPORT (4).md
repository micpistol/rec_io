## 🚨 **Issues Encountered & Resolutions**

### **Issue 1: Automated Installation Failure**
- **Problem**: `complete_installation.sh` script failed on macOS
- **Root Cause**: Script assumed Linux-style PostgreSQL user management
- **Resolution**: Switched to manual installation process
- **Impact**: Minimal - manual process completed successfully

### **Issue 2: Missing Database Schema File**
- **Problem**: `scripts/setup_database_schema.sql` not found
- **Root Cause**: File not included in repository
- **Resolution**: Used existing database initialization functions in code
- **Impact**: None - database properly configured

### **Issue 3: Missing ETH Price Log Table**
- **Problem**: `live_data.eth_price_log` table not present
- **Root Cause**: Table creation script incomplete
- **Resolution**: Manually created table with proper schema
- **Impact**: None - table now exists and verified

### **Issue 4: Service Failures (Expected)**
- **Problem**: Trading services failing to start
- **Root Cause**: Missing Kalshi trading credentials
- **Resolution**: Expected behavior for fresh installation
- **Impact**: None - services will work once credentials added
