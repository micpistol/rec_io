# Ownership Assignment & AI Prompt Index â€“ REC.IO v2

## Purpose
Assign document and component ownership, and provide approved AI prompts for BMAD agents to update or regenerate documentation **without** violating operational safety rules.

> **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE:**  
> **NO AI AGENTS ARE PERMITTED TO PLACE LIVE TRADES FOR TESTING OR ANY OTHER PURPOSES.**  
> **NO AI AGENTS ARE PERMITTED TO ENABLE AUTOMATED TRADING FUNCTIONS FOR TESTING OR ANY OTHER PURPOSES.**  
> **NO AI AGENTS ARE PERMITTED AT ANY TIME TO PLACE LIVE TRADES OR ENABLE AUTOMATED TRADING FOR TESTING OR ANY OTHER PURPOSES.**
> All AI-assisted actions must be limited to documentation, code review, simulation, or analysis using safe datasets.

## 2. AI Prompt Index (Approved Prompts)

### 2.1 Architecture & Components
**Prompt:**  
"Update `System_Overview.md` in `/01_Architecture_Map/` to reflect the current deployed architecture as described in the latest `notes.md`. Ensure all service names, ports, and flows are accurate."

### 2.2 Port & Path Config
**Prompt:**  
"Regenerate `Port_and_Path_Configuration_Reference.md` from `MASTER_PORT_MANIFEST.json` and `config.json`, ensuring no hardcoded ports or paths are added."

### 2.3 Database Schema & Migration
**Prompt:**  
"Update `Database_Schema_and_Migration_Plan.md` to reflect any schema changes in `postgresql_schema.sql` and current legacy migration status."

### 2.4 Deployment Playbook
**Prompt:**  
"Rewrite `Deployment_Playbook.md` to match the current DigitalOcean deployment process, including rollback steps and health check procedures."

### 2.5 CI/CD Guide
**Prompt:**  
"Update `CI_CD_and_Container_Guide.md` to reflect changes in build, test, and deploy pipelines, ensuring compatibility with local-first development."

### 2.6 Security Docs
**Prompt:**  
"Review and update `Secrets_Management_Policy.md` to reflect current secrets handling practices, ensuring plaintext secrets and AI trade execution remain strictly prohibited."

**Prompt:**  
"Update `Disaster_Recovery_Plan.md` to match the current operational recovery procedures for DB failure, service crash, API outage, and broken deploy."

### 2.7 Strategy & Roadmap Docs
**Prompt:**
