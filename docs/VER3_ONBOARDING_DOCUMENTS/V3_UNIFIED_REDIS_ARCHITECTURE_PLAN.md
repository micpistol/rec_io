# V3 UNIFIED REDIS ARCHITECTURE PLAN

**SPRINT START DATE: February 1, 2025**  
**DURATION: 8 weeks**  
**PRIORITY: STRATEGIC - Complete system transformation**

### Phase 1: Foundation & Database Layer (Weeks 1-2)
- Extract database layer into `backend/database/` module
- Create configuration management system (`backend/config/`)
- Implement proper authentication system (`backend/auth/`)
- **Async database operations** - Prepare for Redis integration
- **Connection pooling** - Performance optimization
- **Strict mode enforcement** - PostgreSQL confirmation for user events

### Phase 2: Service Layer & API Modularization (Weeks 3-4)
- Extract business logic to `backend/services/` module
- Split monolithic API into `backend/api/` modules
- Add comprehensive request/response validation
- **Event publishing hooks** - Prepare for Redis events
- **Service interfaces** - Clean architecture foundation
- **Wildcard routing system** - Custom channel pattern support

### Phase 3: Redis Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement Redis infrastructure and `RedisEventRouter`
- Migrate services to event-driven architecture
- Add UUID-based event tracking and checkpointing
- **Stream checkpointing** - Reliable message processing
- **Event deduplication** - Prevent duplicate processing
- **Backpressure handling** - Per-channel drop/coalesce rules

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Production (Weeks 7-8)
- Implement Redis Cluster and advanced features
- Comprehensive testing and production deployment
- **Multi-zone Redis deployment** - Production reliability
- **PostgreSQL-Redis consistency** - Ensure all events traceable

### V3 Success Criteria
- [ ] main.py reduced to <100 lines
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage across all modules
- [ ] Zero hardcoded values in codebase
- [ ] 80-90% reduction in PostgreSQL queries
- [ ] <10ms response time for real-time updates
- [ ] Event-driven architecture with Redis
- [ ] Complete modular architecture
- [ ] Stream lag <100ms under load
- [ ] **Strict mode enforcement** - PostgreSQL confirmation for user events
- [ ] **Event schema compliance** - v1 schema with versioning
- [ ] **Backpressure handling** - Per-channel rules with metrics
