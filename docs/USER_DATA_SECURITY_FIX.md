# User Data Security Fix

## Issue Identified
The deployment package was including personal user information including:
- Email addresses (eric@ewedit.com)
- API keys (8b5698ec-174b-41cf-aea7-52e22a6f8357)
- Authentication tokens
- Username (ewais)

## Files Containing Personal Information
- `backend/data/users/user_0001/auth_tokens.json` - Contains username and auth tokens
- `backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi-auth.txt` - Contains email and API key
- `backend/data/users/user_0001/device_tokens.json` - Contains device tokens

## Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced .gitignore
Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude all user-specific files:
```
# User-specific data (credentials, accounts, etc.)
backend/data/users/
backend/data/users/**/user_info.json
backend/data/users/**/auth_tokens.json
backend/data/users/**/device_tokens.json
backend/data/users/**/credentials/
backend/data/users/**/credentials/**
*.pem
*.key
*.env
```

### 2. Updated Deployment Scripts
Modified all deployment scripts to exclude credentials and personal information:

#### Scripts Updated:
- `scripts/COMPREHENSIVE_DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPT.sh`
- `scripts/package_user_data.sh`
- `scripts/create_complete_backup.sh`
- `scripts/smart_deploy.sh`
- `scripts/one_click_deploy.sh`
- `scripts/install_app.sh`
- `scripts/restore_user_data.sh`

#### Changes Made:
- **Before**: Scripts copied entire `backend/data/users/` directory including credentials
- **After**: Scripts only copy non-sensitive data:
  - Trade history
  - Account data (excluding credentials)
  - Active trades
  - Monitors
  - **Excluded**: credentials, auth_tokens, device_tokens, user_info.json

### 3. Updated Deployment Instructions
Modified deployment documentation to clarify that credentials must be added manually:
- Added security notes about credential exclusion
- Updated instructions to mention manual credential setup
- Clarified that user data packages exclude sensitive information

## Current Status
✅ **User data files are NOT tracked by git** (verified with `git ls-files`)
✅ **All deployment scripts updated** to exclude credentials
✅ **Enhanced .gitignore** prevents future accidental commits
✅ **Deployment instructions updated** to reflect manual credential setup

## Manual Steps Required After Deployment
Users must manually add their credentials after deployment:
1. Create `backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/`
2. Add Kalshi credentials (email and API key)
3. Set proper file permissions (600 for credential files)

## Verification
To verify no user data is being included in deployments:
```bash
# Check if any user files are tracked by git
git ls-files | grep "backend/data/users"

# Check if any credential files exist in repository
find . -name "*.pem" -o -name "*.key" -o -name "*.env" | grep -v venv
```

## Future Prevention
- All new deployment scripts should follow the pattern of excluding credentials
- User setup scripts should prompt for credentials rather than copying them
- Regular security audits should verify no personal data is included in packages
