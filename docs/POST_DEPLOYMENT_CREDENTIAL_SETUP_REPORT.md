# POST-DEPLOYMENT CREDENTIAL SETUP REPORT

## **REC.IO Trading Platform - Post-Deployment Enhancement**
**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Time**: 15:35 UTC  
**Platform**: macOS 24.5.0 (Darwin)  
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL (10/10 Services)**

---

## **Executive Summary**

Following the successful initial deployment of the REC.IO trading platform, additional configuration was required to achieve full operational status. The system initially operated at 70% capacity (7/10 services) due to missing Kalshi trading credentials and a dependency issue. Through systematic troubleshooting and credential configuration, all services are now operational, achieving 100% system functionality.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Resolved credential-dependent service failures
- ✅ Fixed missing dependency (scipy)
- ✅ Achieved 100% service operational status
- ✅ Established full trading platform functionality
- ✅ Configured Kalshi API integration

## **Issues Identified and Resolution Process**

### **Issue 1: Missing Kalshi Trading Credentials**

#### **Problem Description**
Three critical trading services were failing due to missing Kalshi API credentials:
- `kalshi_account_sync`: Required for account synchronization
- `trade_manager`: Required for trade execution management
- `unified_production_coordinator`: Required for production coordination

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- Services expected credentials in `backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/prod/`
- Credentials were created in `backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/`
- File naming mismatch: system expected `kalshi.pem`, we created `kalshi-auth.pem`

#### **Resolution Steps**
1. **Credential Creation**
   ```bash
   # Created kalshi-auth.txt with proper format
   echo "email:m.pistorio@gmail.com" > backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi-auth.txt
   echo "key:a9de18c0-6a3e-4ba0-9702-6c4f55500348" >> backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi-auth.txt
   
   # Copied PEM file content
   cat "/Users/michael/dev/rec_io/Pem fix.txt" > backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi-auth.pem
   
   # Set proper permissions
   chmod 600 backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi-auth.pem
   ```

2. **File Structure Correction**
   ```bash
   # Created expected directory structure
   mkdir -p backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/prod
   mkdir -p backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/demo
   
   # Copied credentials to expected location
   cp backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/* backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/prod/
   cp backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/prod/* backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/demo/
   
   # Renamed PEM file to expected name
   mv backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi-auth.pem backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/kalshi.pem
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Created .env file with proper configuration
   cat > backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/prod/.env << EOF
   KALSHI_API_KEY_ID=a9de18c0-6a3e-4ba0-9702-6c4f55500348
   KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=kalshi-auth.pem
   KALSHI_EMAIL=m.pistorio@gmail.com
   EOF
   ```

### **Issue 2: Missing Python Dependency (scipy)**

#### **Problem Description**
Two services were failing due to missing `scipy` package:
- `trade_manager`: Import error for `scipy.interpolate.griddata`
- `unified_production_coordinator`: Import error for `scipy.interpolate.griddata`

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
- The `requirements-core.txt` file did not include `scipy`
- Services required scipy for probability calculations and data interpolation
- This was a missing dependency that prevented service startup

#### **Resolution Steps**
```bash
# Activated virtual environment and installed scipy
source venv/bin/activate
pip install scipy

# Successfully installed scipy-1.16.1
```

## **Technical Insights and Lessons Learned**

### **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Dual Credential Location Strategy**
   - Maintained credentials in both user-specific and system-expected locations
   - Ensured compatibility with different parts of the system

2. **Proper File Naming Convention**
   - System expected `kalshi.pem`, not `kalshi-auth.pem`
   - File naming must match exactly what the code expects

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Virtual environment must include all required packages
   - Missing dependencies can prevent critical services from starting

4. **Permission Security**
   - Private key files require 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
   - Credential directories require 700 permissions

### **Common Pitfalls Avoided**

1. **Incorrect File Paths**
   - System looked for credentials in `backend/api/kalshi-api/kalshi-credentials/`
   - Not in `backend/data/users/user_0001/credentials/kalshi-credentials/`

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - `scipy` was not in `requirements-core.txt` but required by services
   - Always check import errors in service logs

3. **File Format Mismatches**
   - Credential files must follow exact format expected by the system
   - PEM files must be properly formatted and named
