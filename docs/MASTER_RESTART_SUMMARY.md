# MASTER RESTART SYSTEM - SUMMARY

## 🚀 Overview

The **MASTER RESTART** system is our primary tool for managing the trading system backend. It provides a comprehensive solution that eliminates port conflicts, stale processes, and ensures clean system restarts.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### ✅ **Port Conflict Resolution**
- Flushes all assigned ports (3000, 4000, 6000, 8001, 8002, 8003, 8004, 8005)
- Kills any processes using these ports
- Verifies ports are freed before proceeding

### ✅ **Clean Process Management**
- Graceful shutdown of all services
- Force kill when necessary
- Proper cleanup of socket and PID files

### ✅ **Comprehensive Verification**
- Checks all services are running
- Verifies port assignments
- Provides detailed status reporting

### ✅ **Multiple Restart Options**
- **Master Restart**: Complete restart with port flushing
- **Quick Restart**: Supervisor restart only
- **Emergency Restart**: Force kill everything and restart

## 🛠️ Usage

### Primary Commands
```bash
# Check system status
./scripts/restart status

# Complete restart (recommended)
./scripts/restart

# Quick restart
./scripts/restart quick

# Emergency restart
./scripts/restart emergency
```

### When to Use Each Command

| Command | When to Use | What it Does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `./scripts/restart` | Primary restart method | Flushes ports + restarts all services |
| `./scripts/restart quick` | Minor changes | Restarts supervisor + services only |
| `./scripts/restart emergency` | System stuck | Force kills everything + fresh start |
| `./scripts/restart status` | Before/after changes | Shows current system state |

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Port Assignments
- **3000**: Main web application
- **4000**: Trade manager service  
- **6000**: Active trade supervisor
- **8001**: Trade executor service
- **8002-8005**: Background watchdog services

### Service Types
- **HTTP Servers**: main_app, trade_manager, trade_executor, active_trade_supervisor
- **Background Processes**: btc_price_watchdog, db_poller, kalshi_account_sync, kalshi_api_watchdog

## 📊 Verification Results

### ✅ **Current System Status**
All services are running with proper port assignments:

```
active_trade_supervisor          RUNNING   pid 97602
btc_price_watchdog               RUNNING   pid 97609  
db_poller                        RUNNING   pid 97612
kalshi_account_sync              RUNNING   pid 97617
kalshi_api_watchdog              RUNNING   pid 97620
main_app                         RUNNING   pid 97625
trade_executor                   RUNNING   pid 97628
trade_manager                    RUNNING   pid 97637
```

### ✅ **Port Usage**
- **Active Ports**: 3000, 4000, 6000, 8001 (HTTP servers)
- **Free Ports**: 8002, 8003, 8004, 8005 (background processes - normal)

## 🎯 Integration with Development Workflow

### Standard Workflow
```bash
# 1. Make code changes
# 2. Check current status
./scripts/restart status

# 3. Restart system
./scripts/restart

# 4. Verify everything is working
./scripts/restart status
```

### Before Trading Sessions
```bash
# Ensure clean system state
./scripts/restart status

# If needed, perform clean restart
./scripts/restart
```

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Error Handling
- Script exits on any error (`set -e`)
- Graceful fallbacks for missing processes
- Comprehensive error messages

### Port Safety
- Only flushes assigned ports (3000-8005)
- Avoids system ports (5000, 7000, 9000, 10000)
- Verifies ports are freed before proceeding

### Process Safety
- Graceful shutdown attempts first
- Force kill only when necessary
- Cleanup of socket and PID files

## 📚 Documentation

- **Complete Guide**: `docs/MASTER_RESTART_GUIDE.md`
- **Script Location**: `scripts/MASTER_RESTART.sh`
- **Alias Script**: `scripts/restart`

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### ✅ **System Reliability**
