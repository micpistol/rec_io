# REC.IO Installation Analysis Report

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue #1: Missing Price Watchdog Service (CRITICAL)**
**Status:** ‚ùå **BROKEN**  
**Impact:** System appears functional but uses stale price data

**Root Cause:** The `symbol_price_watchdog` service is missing from the supervisor configuration and cannot start due to Python path issues.

**Evidence:**
- Service missing from `backend/supervisord.conf`
- Attempted manual start failed with: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`
- BTC price data stuck at yesterday's price ($118,275.90 from Aug 14, 17:13:53)
- Main app logs show: `[MAIN] Using PostgreSQL BTC price: $118,275.90`

**Impact on Trading:**
- Trading decisions based on 17+ hour old data
- Real-time price feeds broken
- Momentum calculations incorrect
- Price-sensitive trades will fail

---

### **Issue #2: Python Module Import Path Problems (CRITICAL)**
**Status:** ‚ùå **BROKEN**  
**Impact:** Critical services cannot start manually

**Evidence:**
- `symbol_price_watchdog.py` fails with import errors
- Python path not properly configured for standalone service execution
- Service designed to run outside supervisor but has path dependencies

---

## üîç **SYSTEM STATUS ASSESSMENT**

### **Appearance vs Reality:**
- **Appears:** Fully functional trading system
- **Reality:** Critical price data service broken
- **Risk:** System will make trading decisions on stale data

### **Data Freshness:**
- **Kalshi Data:** Real-time (seconds old)
- **BTC Price Data:** Stale (17+ hours old)
- **Account Data:** Current
- **Market Data:** Current

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEVELOPER ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Immediate Fixes Needed:**

1. **Add `symbol_price_watchdog` to supervisor configuration**
   - Service must run continuously for real-time price updates
   - Fix Python path issues for standalone execution

2. **Resolve Python module import problems**
   - Ensure `backend` module is accessible when running services
   - Fix path configuration for standalone service execution

3. **Verify price data pipeline**
   - Ensure Coinbase WebSocket connection works
   - Validate real-time price updates to database

### **Installation Script Issues:**
- Missing critical service from supervisor config
- Python environment not properly configured for all services
- Service dependencies not fully resolved

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **INSTALLATION VERDICT**

**Status:** ‚ùå **CRITICALLY BROKEN**  
**Reason:** Missing essential price data service makes system unsafe for trading

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT USE** for live trading until price watchdog service is fixed and running.

**What Works:** Kalshi integration, web interface, trade management infrastructure  
**What's Broken:** Real-time price feeds, current market data for trading decisions

## üìä **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

**Machine:** macOS (darwin 24.5.0)  
**Python:** 3.13.6  
**Database:** PostgreSQL 14.19  
**Services Running:** 10/10 supervisor services  
**Critical Services Missing:** 1 (symbol_price_watchdog)  
**Data Freshness:** Mixed (Kalshi: current, BTC: stale)  

**Installation Duration:** ~8 minutes  
**Installation Success:** Partial (infrastructure working, data pipeline broken)  
**Production Readiness:** ‚ùå **NOT READY** - Critical data service missing

---

## üîç **INVESTIGATION SUMMARY**

### **What Was Tested:**
- Complete installation script execution
- Service status verification
- Data freshness checks
- API endpoint testing
- Manual service startup attempts

### **Critical Findings:**
1. **System appears fully functional** but is actually broken
2. **Missing price watchdog service** prevents real-time data updates
3. **Python path configuration** issues prevent manual service startup
4. **Stale price data** makes system unsafe for trading

### **Risk Assessment:**
**HIGH RISK** - System could execute trades based on outdated market information, leading to significant financial losses.
