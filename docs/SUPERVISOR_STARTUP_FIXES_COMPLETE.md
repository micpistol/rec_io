# Supervisor Startup Fixes - Complete Implementation

## 📋 **Issue Summary**

**Problem**: Installation script appeared successful but left system completely non-functional because supervisor daemon was never properly started or verified.

**Root Cause**: Script lacked proper error handling, timeouts, and verification steps for supervisor startup process.

**Impact**: 100% of installations appeared successful but were non-operational.

## 🔧 **Comprehensive Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Supervisor Startup Process**

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```bash
# Start supervisor
supervisord -c backend/supervisord.conf

# Wait for supervisor to be ready
log_info "Waiting for supervisor to be ready..."
sleep 3

# Verify supervisor is actually running and responsive
log_info "Verifying supervisor is running..."
if ! supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    log_error "Supervisor failed to start or is not responsive"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### **After (Robust)**
```bash
# Verify supervisor configuration exists and is valid
if [ ! -f "backend/supervisord.conf" ]; then
    log_error "Supervisor configuration file not found: backend/supervisord.conf"
    exit 1
fi

log_info "Verifying supervisor configuration..."
if ! supervisord -c backend/supervisord.conf -n; then
    log_error "Supervisor configuration is invalid"
    exit 1
fi

# Start supervisor with better error handling
log_info "Starting supervisor daemon..."
supervisord -c backend/supervisord.conf &
SUPERVISOR_PID=$!

# Wait for supervisor to be ready with timeout
log_info "Waiting for supervisor to be ready..."
TIMEOUT=30
COUNTER=0

while [ $COUNTER -lt $TIMEOUT ]; do
    if supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        log_success "Supervisor is running and responsive"
        break
    fi
    
    # Check if supervisor process is still alive
    if ! kill -0 $SUPERVISOR_PID 2>/dev/null; then
        log_error "Supervisor process died unexpectedly"
        log_info "Checking for supervisor errors..."
        if [ -f "logs/supervisord.log" ]; then
            log_info "Supervisor log contents:"
            tail -20 logs/supervisord.log
        fi
        exit 1
    fi
    
    sleep 1
    COUNTER=$((COUNTER + 1))
    if [ $((COUNTER % 5)) -eq 0 ]; then
        log_info "Still waiting for supervisor... ($COUNTER/$TIMEOUT seconds)"
    fi
done

if [ $COUNTER -eq $TIMEOUT ]; then
    log_error "Supervisor failed to become responsive within $TIMEOUT seconds"
    log_info "Supervisor process status:"
    ps aux | grep supervisord | grep -v grep || true
    log_info "Supervisor socket status:"
    ls -la /tmp/supervisord.sock 2>/dev/null || echo "Socket file not found"
    log_info "Supervisor log contents:"
    if [ -f "logs/supervisord.log" ]; then
        tail -20 logs/supervisord.log
    fi
    exit 1
fi
```

### **2. Enhanced Service Startup Process**

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```bash
# Start only non-trading services initially
log_info "Starting non-trading services..."
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf start main || true
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf start symbol_price_watchdog_btc || true
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf start strike_table_generator || true
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf start system_monitor || true

# Wait for services to start
log_info "Waiting for non-trading services to start..."
sleep 3
```

#### **After (Robust)**
```bash
# Start services with better error handling
for service in main symbol_price_watchdog_btc strike_table_generator system_monitor; do
    log_info "Starting service: $service"
    if supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf start $service; then
        log_success "Service $service started successfully"
    else
        log_warning "Service $service failed to start (this may be expected)"
    fi
done

# Wait for services to start with timeout
log_info "Waiting for non-trading services to start..."
TIMEOUT=30
COUNTER=0

while [ $COUNTER -lt $TIMEOUT ]; do
    # Check if critical services are running
    CRITICAL_RUNNING=true
    for service in main system_monitor; do
        if ! supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service | grep -q "RUNNING"; then
            CRITICAL_RUNNING=false
            break
        fi
    done
    
    if [ "$CRITICAL_RUNNING" = true ]; then
        log_success "Critical services are running"
        break
    fi
    
    sleep 2
    COUNTER=$((COUNTER + 2))
    if [ $((COUNTER % 10)) -eq 0 ]; then
        log_info "Still waiting for critical services... ($COUNTER/$TIMEOUT seconds)"
        log_info "Current service status:"
        supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status | grep -E "(main|system_monitor)" || true
    fi
done
```

### **3. Enhanced Service Verification**

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```bash
# Verify critical non-trading services are running
log_info "Verifying critical non-trading services..."
for service in main system_monitor; do
    if ! supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service | grep -q "RUNNING"; then
        log_error "Critical service $service is not running"
        log_info "Service status:"
        supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service
        exit 1
    fi
done
```

#### **After (Robust)**
```bash
# Verify critical non-trading services are running
log_info "Verifying critical non-trading services..."
for service in main system_monitor; do
    if ! supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service | grep -q "RUNNING"; then
        log_error "Critical service $service is not running after $TIMEOUT seconds"
        log_info "Service status:"
        supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service
        log_info "Service log (if available):"
        if [ -f "logs/$service.log" ]; then
            tail -10 logs/$service.log
        fi
        exit 1
    else
        log_success "Critical service $service is running"
    fi
done
```

### **4. Enhanced Trading Service Verification**

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```bash
# Check trading service status
log_info "Checking trading service status..."
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status | grep -E "(kalshi|trade|unified)"

log_success "Trading services started with credentials"
```

#### **After (Robust)**
```bash
# Check trading service status and verify they're running
log_info "Checking trading service status..."
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status | grep -E "(kalshi|trade|unified)"

# Verify trading services are running
log_info "Verifying trading services are running..."
for service in kalshi_account_sync trade_manager unified_production_coordinator; do
    if ! supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service | grep -q "RUNNING"; then
        log_warning "Trading service $service is not running (this may be expected without valid credentials)"
        log_info "Service status:"
        supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status $service
    else
        log_success "Trading service $service is running"
    fi
done

log_success "Trading services started with credentials"
```

### **5. Final System Verification**

#### **New Addition**
```bash
# Final verification - check web interface is responding
log_info "Performing final system verification..."
sleep 5  # Give services time to fully start

# Check if web interface is responding
log_info "Checking web interface..."
if curl -s http://localhost:3000/health >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    log_success "Web interface is responding"
else
    log_warning "Web interface is not responding yet (may need more time to start)"
    log_info "You can check manually: curl http://localhost:3000/health"
fi

# Final status check
log_info "Final system status:"
supervisorctl -c backend/supervisord.conf status
```
